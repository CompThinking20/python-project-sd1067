This is a great start to this project. I ran your test file and got an error when trying to set a level, but that's no complaint for this phase of the project. Looking through your code, however, I don't see any glaring errors or patterns that give me pause. My recommendation is twofold: one, document a bit better. Many of your variables have good comments, but your classes and functions don't always, and that's the most important thing. In the absence of a working program, it was hard for me to really give feedback without extensive commenting. The second thing to do for the next phase is to actually get the user involved. Maybe create a default character in the code just to be able to run it?
